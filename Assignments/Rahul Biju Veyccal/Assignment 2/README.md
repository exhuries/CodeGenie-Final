### Assignment 2 â€“ Development Phase

In this phase, I contributed to both frontend and backend work. I coordinated the development of the Streamlit interface and also ensured proper model loading using `llama-cpp-python`. I was involved in debugging, testing the app in Colab, and assisting with connecting the prompt input to the model and output display. I also helped others integrate their parts smoothly.
