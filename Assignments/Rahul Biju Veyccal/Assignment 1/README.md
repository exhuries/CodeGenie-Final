### Assignment 1 – Ideation and Setup

As a team, we brainstormed and finalized the idea of building CodeGenie – an AI-powered code generation tool using CodeLlama. I contributed by helping structure the project, setting up the GitHub repository, and finalizing the tools and model (Streamlit, Google Colab, LocalTunnel, and CodeLlama). I actively participated in task division and documentation planning.
