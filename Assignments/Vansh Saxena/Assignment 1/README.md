### Assignment 1 â€“ Ideation and Setup

I contributed to the initial planning by researching how to run large models like CodeLlama efficiently on limited hardware. I explored quantization techniques and helped finalize using a 4-bit GGUF model with `llama-cpp-python`. I also assisted in organizing tasks and understanding Colab's GPU/CPU capabilities.
